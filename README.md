# cdeez

some relearning of c, since it's a cool language

## setup

make sure that the `compile.sh` script has execution permissions:

```sh
chmod +x compile.sh
```

then run the compile script (note that cdeez is always being compiled with debug information):

```sh
./compile.sh
```

finally you can start the compiled binary:

```bash
./cdeez
```
